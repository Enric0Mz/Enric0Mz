I am a developer dedicated to problem-solving, not just using technologies. I believe that the focus of development is to create innovative solutions that generate value in general, and that the chosen technology is just a means to that end. Therefore, I am always willing to take on any challenge because learning leads me to my ultimate goal.

### Learning Goals

I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and skills in various areas of software development. Here are some of my current learning goals:

- **Deepen Understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms:** Strengthen my understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms to improve problem-solving abilities and optimize code efficiency.

- **Mastering Cloud Technologies:** Dive deeper into cloud computing platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS) to enhance my skills in cloud architecture, deployment, and management.

- **Advancing in Software Design Patterns:** Learn and apply advanced software design patterns to write cleaner, more maintainable, and scalable code, promoting best practices in software development.

These learning goals reflect my commitment to continuous improvement and my passion for staying updated with the latest advancements in technology. I'm excited to embark on this journey of learning and growth!
